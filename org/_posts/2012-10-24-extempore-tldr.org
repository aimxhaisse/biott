If you've just stumbled across this site, you've probably got a few
high-level questions about what Extempore is.  Primarily, Extempore is
two things:

- Extempore is *a single binary executable*. You can download an
  =extempore= executable for OS X, Linux and Windows which will run in
  any shell (or =cmd.exe= on Windows). It has no external library
  dependencies except for the files in the =runtime= directory, which
  is part of the Extempore source distribution. The Extempore source
  also contains some other useful libraries and example code, but the
  only things that you /need/ are the =extempore= executable and the
  =runtime= directory.

- Extempore is *a programming languages project*. The =extempore=
  executable provides a compiler/interpreter and runtime for /two/
  programming languages: Scheme and [[file:2012-08-09-xtlang-type-reference.org][xtlang]]. xtlang is a new
  programming language (and active research project) for which the
  =extempore= binary provides the reference compiler implementation.
  xtlang (and Extempore more generally) is a general-purpose
  programming language, it is /not/ just a DSL for audiovisual media
  art. Certainly there is great library support for audio and
  graphics, but this is due to the predilections of the current user
  base rather than any limitations of the language. If you want to go
  and write a library for high-frequency trading or gene sequencing in
  xtlang, you can---and maybe you /should/ :)

For more detail on Extempore's design philosophy, check out [[file:2012-08-07-extempore-philosophy.org][this post]].
An index of the Extempore documentation is [[file:../index.org][available here]].
