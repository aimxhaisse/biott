The easiest way to get up and running with Extempore is to download a
binary version. A binary is an [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable][executable]] which someone has already
compiled for your platform (operating system & architecture), so you
can just copy it into place and run it.

The 'minimal' possible Extempore setup requires the =extempore=
executable and the =runtime= directory which is loaded when the
executable starts up.[fn:startup] The executable provides the basic
runtime environment (including todo the scheduler) while the =.xtm=
files in =runtime= provide some other necessary infrastructure (such
as the xtlang compiler).

[fn:startup] todo This post shows how to start up and interact with
    the =extempore= executable.
