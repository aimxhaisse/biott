* General emacs stuff

Load theme: M-x 'load-theme' (then pick from the list)
Open file: C-x C-f
Split window horizontally: C-x 2
Split window vertically: C-x 3
Switch to buffer: C-x b (then the name)
Jump to other window (in split window setup): C-x o

Beginning of line: C-a
End of line of line: C-e
Set/unset mark: C-<space> (for highlighting)
Kill line: C-k

Cancel: C-g (if you get into trouble)
Help (function): C-h f, then function name
Help (variable): C-h v, then variable name

* Working with Extempore code

1. Start up Extempore in a shell buffer with 'M-x shell'
2. Open up an extempore file (.xtm extension)
3. Connect to the running Extempore process: C-x C-j (needs to be done for every .xtm buffer)

Then, to evaluate (compile) xtlang code, use:

Evaluate enclosing s-expression: C-x C-x
Evaluate region: C-x C-r
Evaluate whole buffer: C-x C-b

To restart the Extempore process, just C-c C-c in the *shell* buffer
where it is running to kill it, then start it up again.
