Well, I've got a new home on the interwebs.  Currently I'm working
pretty hard on my PhD thesis, and my head is too full of things worry
about this blogging caper.  But once that's out of the way we'll see
what happens.

If you're looking for my live coding videos, they're up at [vimeo](http://vimeo.com/benswift/videos).

If you're keen to get in touch, [send me an email](mailto:benjamin.j.swift@gmail.com).
