I'm a Senior Research Assistant at Queensland University
of Technology and also an [[http://people.cecs.anu.edu.au/user/3895][Adjunct Research Assistant]] in the School of
Computer Science at the Australian National University.

My primary research interest these days is *live coding*, and I'm
currently working on the [[https://github.com/digego/extempore][Extempore]] project (as you may have been able
to guess from the content of this blog). Before Extempore came along I
was an [[http://impromptu.moso.com.au][Impromptu]] user, and have been live coding since 2007. You can
check out some of my screencasts at my [[http://vimeo.com/benswift/videos][vimeo page]].

I recently submitted my PhD thesis, and I'm still waiting to hear back
from the examiners---fingers crossed! My research project was
cross-disciplinary, mainly between computer science and digital media.
Prior to that I did a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics. I'm
a Canberra lad, born and bred.

If you want to get in touch, email is best---you can reach me on

# I live mainly in the world of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI),
# although I also have a digital artist (Dr. Alistair Riddell) and a
# geographer (Dr. David Bissell) on my panel. I'm interested in group
# musical collaboration, and specifically the patterns of engagement
# between musicians in that context. I've built an iOS-based group
# jamming system called Viscotheque, and I've been using it to jam
# around with some musicians from around campus. If you'd like to get
# involved, [[mailto:benjamin.j.swift@gmail.com][drop me a line]].

# I'm also interested in critically examining the logical-positivist
# underpinnings of HCI theory and practice, especially when it comes to
# computers and group musical creativity. I'm encouraged by recent
# critiques and proposed alternative foundations, such as Dourish's
# /embodied computing/, McCarthy and Wright's /technology as experience/
# and Bardzell's /interaction criticism/. I've increasingly found myself
# thinking in those (and related) spaces as I try to understand the use
# of computing devices in open-ended group interaction.
