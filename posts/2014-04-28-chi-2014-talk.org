I'm currently at the [[http://chi2014.acm.org/][CHI conference]], and if you're there too then you
should come to my talk on *Coding Livecoding*, 10am Tuesday in room
716A.

If you've stumbled across this blog because you came to that talk,
then welcome :) I hope you can find what you're looking for. If you
want to catch up for a chat before the end of the conference, [[mailto:benswift@fastmail.com][send me
an email]] and we can tee something up.
