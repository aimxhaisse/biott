Here are the steps to building and loading the Extempore standard
library:

- make sure you've set your =EXT_LLVM_DIR= environment variable to
  point to your LLVM build directory[fn::if you're using homebrew on
  OSX, the default location will be
  =/usr/local/Cellar/extempore/3.2=]
- in a new Extempore session, eval the file =libs/create-stdlib.xtm=
  from top to bottom (or load it at startup with =./extempore --run
  libs/create-stdlib.xtm=)
- if the standard library compiles successfully, follow the
  instructions printed to the log and move the =xtm.dylib= / =xtm.so=
  into your =extempore/= directory.

Then you're done. To load the standard lib, use =(sys:load
libs/xtm.xtm)= and you'll have all the main maths, audio and graphics
libraries loaded up. This takes the Extempore startup time on my
machine from several minutes down to about 4 seconds. Pretty handy if
you're having to start it up regularly as I am :)

You can pre-compile /any/ xtlang code in this fashion, not just the
the standard library. I'll put together a blog post on that at some
stage, but the basic ideas can be gleaned from taking a look at
=libs/create-stdlib.xtm= and =libs/xtm.xtm=.

*Note to Windows users*: [[https://github.com/arrian][Arrian]] has being doing some good things with
Extempore on Windows recently. If you want to find out where he's up
to you should drop us all a line on the [[mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com][extempore mailing list]].
