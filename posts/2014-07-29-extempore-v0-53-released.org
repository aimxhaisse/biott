Just a heads up that I’ve pushed an Extempore v0.53 (=b534ba2=)
release to homebrew. It includes fixes for a few of the things we’ve
been discussing on the list recently, as well as the new
precompilation stuff (see [[file:2013-12-16-building-the-extempore-standard-library.org][this post]] for more info).

Anyway, if you’re using homebrew, then 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew update
brew outdated   # extempore should show up as outdated
brew upgrade
#+END_SRC

should do the trick.

Also, if you’ve used homebrew but built from HEAD (i.e. =brew install
--HEAD extempore=) then you’ll need to *either*

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew reinstall --HEAD extempore 
# this will keep you up with the current head, which is always a manual process (no auto-update)
#+END_SRC

*or*

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
2. brew rm extempore && brew install extempore 
# this’ll move you to 0.53, which is currently the tip of git master anyway
#+END_SRC

Note that if you’ve built from source, then just =git pull=, rebuild
with =./all.bash= and we’ll all be on the same page.
