I'm doing a livecoding set (actually /two/ livecoding sets)

- *Date:* Friday May 30
- *Time:*
  - /Set 1:/ 3:30pm--4:30pm
  - /Set 2:/ 4:30pm--5:30pm 
- *Location:* [[http://lostoncampus.com.au/13229][Room N101]], Building 108 (CSIT building), ANU

As well as being a chance for me to drop some beats, these sets are
going to be part of a research project on visualisation and
livecoding. That's why there are two sets: we're trying two different
visualisation approaches, and after each set you'll get a chance to
fill out a short feedback survey (either on paper or on your mobile
phone). It's science!

Come to either set. All welcome, no cover charge. Be part of science.
