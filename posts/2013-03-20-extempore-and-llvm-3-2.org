#+title: Extempore and LLVM 3.2

Extempore has recently been updated to build against LLVM 3.2, and
this morning I've pushed the changes to the =master= branch on GitHub.
We've tested it and are fairly convinced that it's working well,
although as always bug reports (and patches) are welcome on the
[[mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com][mailing list]] :)

The 'building Extempore' instructions have been updated too, for [[file:../2013-03-20-building-extempore-on-osx-linux.org][OSX &
Linux]] and [[file:../2013-03-20-building-extempore-on-windows.org][Windows]].  The build process on OSX is a bit nicer than
before if you're a [[http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/][homebrew]] user---there's a formula for building a
specially patched version of LLVM in the =extras/= subdirectory.

Development is coming along, and I'll hopefully be putting up some
new screencasts in the next few days.
