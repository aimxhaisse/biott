These conventions aren't (currently) used consistently throughout the
Extempore codebase, but we're hoping to bring everything into line
eventually---pull requests welcome :)

* Scheme conventions

- *Spaces* in names should use dashes (=-=), e.g. =my-scheme-variable=
- *Predicates* (functions that /test/ their arguments and return =#t= or
  =#f=) should end in =?=, e.g. =integer?=
- *Destructive functions* (which modify their arguments in-place) should
  end in a =!=, e.g. =set-cdr!=
- *Global variables* should be surrounded by =*=, e.g.
  =*my-scheme-global*=

* xtlang conventions

Some of the differences between the xtlang and the Scheme conventions
are for technical reasons (xtlang's identifiers have the same
limitations as C, e.g. no =!=), while others are to help differentiate
between Scheme and xtlang visually (e.g. dashes in Scheme vs
underscores in xtlang).

- *Closures* should use "snake case", e.g. =my_xtlang_closure=
- *Types* (except for the [[file:2012-08-09-xtlang-type-reference.org][built-in types]]) should use "camel case",
  with a capitalised first letter e.g. =MyType=
- Closures associated with a named type should start with the name of
  the type (e.g. =MyType_create=, =MyType_do_all_the_things=)
- If a closure allocates [[file:2012-08-17-memory-management-in-extempore.org][zone memory]] (i.e. if it calls =alloc= or
  =zalloc=) then there should be another version of the closure with
  the suffix =_h= which allocates from the heap (i.e. =halloc=)
  instead
- *Global variables* should be uppercased, e.g.
  =MY_XTLANG_GLOBAL=
# - *Predicates* (functions that /test/ their arguments and return =TRUE= or
#   =FALSE=) should end in =p= (for single word predicates) or =_p= (for
#   multi-word predicates), e.g. =integerp=, =unicode_char_p=

* Capitalisation conventions

- In writing, /Extempore/ should be capitalised, while /xtlang/ should
  remain uncapitalised.
