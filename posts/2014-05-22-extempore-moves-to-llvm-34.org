Hey folks

Extempore is keeping pace with LLVM updates, and I've just pushed some
changes to use LLVM 3.4.1.  

*If you build Extempore from source yourself*, [[file:2013-03-20-building-extempore-on-osx-linux.org][the instructions]] have
been updated (do a a =git pull= to make sure you've got the latest
Extempore source).

*If you build Extempore through [[file:2013-11-12-building-extempore-through-homebrew.org][homebrew]]*, then you should be able to
do a =brew update; brew upgrade= and everything will magically update
itself.

Happy hacking.  As usual, if everything breaks, let us know on the
[[mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com][mailing list]].
