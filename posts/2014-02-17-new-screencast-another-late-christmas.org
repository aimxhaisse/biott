Another livecoding screencast in Extempore. I had planned to put it up
at Christmas time, but holidays and things meant that it's going up in
February, hence the title :)

As usual, all instruments are pure xtlang, and this time they're in
the main Extempore trunk.  The 'beats' are just me adding white noise
(through the =random= function) straight into the =dsp= callback, and
the distortion is also just =dsp= callback shenanigans.

The samples I'm using are from the freely-avaliable [[http://sso.mattiaswestlund.net/][Sonatina Symphonic
Orchestra]] sample pack put together by Mattias Westlund.

Also, if you're in Canberra I'm going to be performing at a couple of
local festivals in March, I'll post the details on this blog as soon
as they're locked in.
