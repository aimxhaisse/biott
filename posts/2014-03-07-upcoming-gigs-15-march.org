If you're in Canberra, Australia (or are willing to make a trip) then
I've got two upcoming livecoding gigs, *both on Saturday March 15*

- [[http://artnotapart.com/live-coding][Art, Not Apart]] Festival, 4:20pm, New Acton
- [[http://youareherecanberra.com.au/events/cmag/in-case-of-sound-round-one/][You Are Here]] Festival, 9pm, Canberra Museum and Gallery

Both gigs are free, and it'd be great to see you there :)
