This page used to have info about downloading pre-compiled Extempore
binaries.  Unfortunately, that experiment didn't really work
out---trying to keep binary compatibility between all the libs across
all the OSes was just a massive pain.

A (hopefully) better approach to making it easier to get up and
running with Extempore is through Homebrew, and you can read about how
to do that [[file:2013-11-12-building-extempore-through-homebrew.org][here]].  Of course, building from source is still an option
as well ([[file:../2013-03-20-building-extempore-on-osx-linux.org][OSX & Linux]], [[file:../2013-03-20-building-extempore-on-windows.org][Windows]]).

Still, I want to give a big thankyou to everyone who helped out with
testing the binaries :)
