This blog has gotten a coat of paint recently, as you can probably
tell if you've visited in the past.  I've moved from [[http://octopress.org/][octopress]] &
[[https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll][jekyll]] to a (still static) site powered by [[https://github.com/nakkaya/static][static]] with my own
theme, hand-rolled with a little help from [[http://semantic-ui.com/][Semantic UI]].

All the links should still work, and I'm also categorising my
Extempore docs with [[http://benswift.me/tags/index.html][tags]] as well as the usual hand-curated [[http://benswift.me/extempore-docs/index.html][docs]] page.

As usual, if you find any problems, then [[mailto:ben@benswift.me][let me know]].
